# Model analysis project

Our project is titled **Dynamic shocks in a short-run AS/AD-model** and examines an extended model of the short-run model presented in the course "Macroeconomics II". Our model extends the basic supply shock model by adding stochastic supply shocks and persistence for these shocks in able to capture a glance of naturally occuring business cycles in an economy.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires the following installations:

``pip install pandas``
``pip install numpy``
``pip install matplotlib.pyplot``
``pip install ipywidgets``

Be aware that running the last chuck of code can have a runtime of 10-30 seconds.
